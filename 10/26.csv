\le p < \infty$ and
  $$r = ({1\over k} \sum ^n_1 |u_i|^p)^{1\over p}$$
  then the volume of the symmetric convex body whose boundary functionals are
$\pm u_1,\ldots, \pm u_n$, is bounded from below as
  $$|\{ x\in {\Bbb R}^k\colon \ |\langle x,u_i\rangle | \le 1 \ \hbox{for

  An application to number theory is stated.

"math/9201204",,"Keith Ball","Shadows of convex bodies",,,,"Banach Archive 10/26/89","math.MG math.FA",,"  It is proved that if $C$ is a convex body in ${\Bbb R}^n$ then $C$ has an
affine image $\widetilde C$ (of non-zero volume) so that if $P$ is any
1-codimensional orthogonal projection,
  $$|P\widetilde C| \ge |\widetilde C|^{n-1\over n}.$$
  It is also shown that there is a pathological body, $K$, all of whose
orthogonal projections have volume about $\sqrt{n}$ times as large as
$|K|^{n-1\over n}$.
